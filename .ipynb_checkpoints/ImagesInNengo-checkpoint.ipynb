      "We want to build a simple memory network that will take a compressed vector representation of an image and populate a 'visual buffer' with a given image. But how should we represent the image? Normally, an image is an m x n array of pixels with aspect ratio m : n. We can't store m x n pixels for k images, too many and wasteful. Want to compress. Idea: use SVD on images. Problem: digital grayscale images are functions Img : {1,...,m}x{1,...,n} -> {1,...,255}. We cannot SVD an array of two-dimensional vectors (matrices), so we flatten them and SVD the resulting array of 1 x mn vectors.\n",

The great thing this lets us do is truncate U (and hence V) to get some lossy compression, so the network can represent Imgs. There is a normalization issue, but I will get to that.\n",
