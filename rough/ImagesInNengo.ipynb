      "We want to build a simple memory network that will take a compressed vector representation of an image and populate a 'visual buffer' with a given image. But how should we represent the image? Normally, an image is an m x n array of pixels with aspect ratio m : n. We can't store m x n pixels for k images, too many and wasteful. Want to compress. Idea: use SVD on images. \n",

The great thing this lets us do is truncate $U$ (and hence $V$) to get some lossy compression, so the network can represent $Imgs$. There is a normalization issue, but I will get to that.\n",
